<h1>
    Reeve. A Simple, Straightforward Language made to handle Data, File writing, and more.
</h1>
<p>
    ReeveScript is a lightweight library that contains features like
</p>
<li>
    Data Handling
</li>
<li>
    File Checking
</li>
<li>
    Formatting
</li>
<



































 And a Lot more.

<P>
    BACKSTORY: Reeve is a simple Framework made in c++ used for generally writing scripts for mostly anything. And while reeve is its own language, i'd say it'd depend on about 50-60% of the C API to function how it should.
 </P>
<p>
    It was made to basically turn c++ Into easier Syntax, And sort of make a "comfortable" Modern type Syntax which you may see in languages like Python, Ruby, Etc. . .
</p>
<p>
    If you're reading this, im guessing you've probably already set things up and you're ready to code.
</p>
<p>
    There are many ways to go about this, one way is to just open up the .sln file inside of it, create a new file in the "ext" Folder, Then Include the reeve header/piler file, then you have every function in your possession.
</p>
<p>
    Like i said, there are many ways to do the Reeve Things in C++ and C, But i felt C/C++ Syntax Would've been easier to read if i just bundled it up and made it with certain functionalities.
